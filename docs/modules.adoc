## Modules

### Declare new module

A modul will be automatically integrated in typexs framework when it is explicit declared as a typexs module.

The declaration is done by a new entry "typexs" in the package.json.
The only necessary information is the name for the module in the typexs context.

```js
{
    "name": "my-typexs-module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "typexs": {
        "name": "my-typexs-module"
    }
}
```

A modul containing this declaration and whose location is under

```
./node_modules
# or
./packages
# or
./src/packages
```

will be automatically integrated on startup of the framework.

In the "typexs" section of the package.json can also be added additional declartions for modul specific autoload paths, which are processed by the module to look up for addons or extensions.
For example if the module implements an api which can be dynamically used or extended.
Other modules extensions can be automatically integrated by placing their extensions under the specific path and when the handling module loads it can load all the other extensions.

```js
{
    // ...
    "typexs": {
        "name": "my-typexs-module",
        "declareLibs": [
            {
                "topic": "my_great_extension",
                "refs": [
                    // using glob pattern from modul
                    // root path (where package.json is placed)
                    "GreatExtension",
                    // using src prefix for local development lookups
                    "src/GreatExtension",
                    // using directories
                    "src/great_extensions/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    // ...
}
```

Modules extending "my-typexs-module" can put their code under the declared ref paths and they will be handled be "my-typexs-module".

To get programmatically all declared classes for a topic can be done through the RuntimeLoader class object like this:

```typescript
import {RuntimeLoader, IActivator} from '@typexs/base';

export class Activator implements IActivator {

    @Inject(RuntimeLoader.NAME)
    loader: RuntimeLoader;

    startup(){
        // getting all implemented classes declared by this modul
        const classes = this.loader.getClasses('my_great_extension');
        // doing something ...
    }
}
```

During the booting of typexs all declared modules are looked up and their settings are analysed to get all the declared paths and dependencies between them.
Additionally declaring topic paths can be overridden by the configuration.

Through the analysis of the dependencies the correct modul load order is determined and during the bootstrap considered.

The bootstrap of modules happens in three stages.
At first we start with

* the activation stage followed by
* the startup stage and ending with
* the ready stage.

The activations stage is for handling initial modul specific configurations or declaring classes or instance for dependency injection, which can or must be present for the second stage the startup.
To hook in the activation stage the module must have a Activator.(t|j)s (or src/Activator.(t|j)s) file with a class implementing the IActivator interface from @typexs/base.
Some objects are at this point ready for injection, if they are needed:

* Storage +
+
--
```typescript
@Inject(Storage.NAME)
storage: Storage;
```
--

* StorageRef's
+
--
```typescript
// C_DEFAULT_STORAGE = 'storage.default'
@Inject(C_DEFAULT_STORAGE)
storageRef: StorageRef;
```
--

* RuntimeLoader
+
--
```typescript
@Inject(RuntimeLoader.NAME)
loader: RuntimeLoader;
```
--

Here an example:

```typescript
// ./Activator.ts

import {IActivator, Injector} from '@typexs/base';

export class Activator implements IActivator {

    startup(){
        // modul specific stuff
        const config = Config.get('my_stuff')
        const handler = new MyHandler(config);
        Injector.set(MyHandler, handler);
    }
}
```

In the second stage of bootstrap all activation over all modules are done and ready for usage.
In this stage you can do initial loading, registering or processing and stuff that is necessary to make the modul work properly.
To hook in this stage the module must have a Startup.(t|j)s (or src/Startup.(t|j)s) file with a class implementing the IBootstrap (for shutdown operation the IShutdown interface) interface from @typexs/base.

```typescript
// ./Startup.ts

import {IBootstrap, Inject} from '@typexs/base';

export class Startup implements IBootstrap {

    @Inject(MyHandler)
    greatHandler: MyHandler;


    bootstrap(){
        this.greatHandler.letsRock();
    }
}
```

The last stage is executed after the startup stage.
In this stage all modules went through activation and startup so the system is fully ready for further processing.
This stage can be used if the module depends on fully loaded system.
To hook in this stage is to use the interface IStartup and implement the method ready().

```typescript
// ./Startup.ts

import {IBootstrap, Inject} from '@typexs/base';

export class Startup implements IBootstrap {

    @Inject(MyHandler)
    greatHandler: MyHandler;

    ready(){
        this.greatHandler.fireMessageSystemIsReady();
    }
}
```

The hooking in the stages is optional and depends only on developer archtecture or integration level decision.
So a typexs module could also implement only some extensions without interact with the bootstrap.

### Configuration

The integration of modules can also be configurated through the default configuration file(s) under

 config/typexs.yml

or also if the framework is used programatically in tests for example:

```typescript
(async function(){
    const bootstrap = Bootstrap
      .setConfigSources([{type: 'system'}])
      .configure(<ITypexsOptions & any>{
        // Put here the configuration
        modules: {
            // additonal modul lookup paths (if there are further "node_modules" present,
            // they will be scanned too)
            paths: [
                __dirname + '/../furtherTxsModules'
            ],

            // Additional lookup root keys in the package.json
            // for example: {..., hc_module: { myMod:true }, ... }
            packageKeys: [
                'hc_module'
            ],

            // like "declareLibs" but can be added in the configuration
            libs: [
                {
                    topic: 'entity.default',
                    refs: [
                        'better/entity/path'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
      });
    bootstrap.activateLogger();
    bootstrap.activateErrorHandling();
    await bootstrap.prepareRuntime();
    await bootstrap.activateStorage();
    await bootstrap.startup();

    // ... do something ...

    await bootstrap.shutdown();

})();
```

#### Additional lookup paths

To define additional lookup paths which will be scanned for typexs modules at startup set the configuration key 'modules.paths'.
The value must be an array of path where typexs modules could be present.
If under the given paths there are 'node_modules' subpaths then they will be also scanned.

```yml
# config/typexs.yml

modules:
    paths:
    - ../lookupAdd
    - local/new/path
```

#### Declared contextualised lookups

Like in the section "Declare new module" with the key 'typexs.declareLibs' in the package.json we can extend or create new declarations for addon/extensions lookups by using the configuration key 'modules.libs'.

Each entry must contain a representing string value under the key 'topic' for the context of the lookuped files and a array under the key 'refs' which can contain multiple values describing the file location, like directories or glob patterns.

When a topic is already present it will be extended be the additional paths else a new topic for lookup will be created.

```yml
# config/typexs.yml
modules:
    libs:
    - topic: entity.default
      refs:
        - additional/place/for/entities
        - additional/entities/*Default*
    - topic: new_topic
      refs:
        - new_topic
```

To get all classes under a topic use

```typescript

// ... load framework
const classes = Injector.get(RuntimerLoader.NAME).getClasses('{your_topic_name}');
// ... shutdown framework
```

#### Enabling/disabling modules

Modules found under node_modules or packages (or src/packages) are all automatically enabled if not explicit declared as disabled.
By configuration can be the disable status be declared.
There are two variants for disabling modules:

* one by setting the value ot false for the configuration key 'modules.included.my-modul.enable' like:
+
--
```yml
# config/typexs.yml
modules:
    included:
        my-modul:
            enabled: false
```
--

* the other by declaring pattern under the key 'modules.match'
+
--
```yml
# config/typexs.yml
modules:
    match:
    - name: 'module*'
      enabled: false
```

All modules matching the pattern will be disabled.
--

#### Caching

Modules are lookuped up by the RuntimeLoader in the subdirectories like "packages", "node_modules" and their subdirectories.
Those informations are cached under the given cache path or by default under "/tmp/.txs/cache".

```yml
# config/typexs.yml
modules:
    cachePath: /tmp/.txs/cache
```

#### Further configuration options

The full configuration is declared under `src/base/IRuntimeLoaderOptions` interface.
