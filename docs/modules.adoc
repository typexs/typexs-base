## Modules

### Declare new module

A modul will be automatically integrated in typexs framework
when it is explicit declared as a typexs module.

The declaration is done by a new entry "typexs" in the package.json.
The only necessary information is the name for the module in the typexs
context.

```js
{
    "name": "my-typexs-module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "typexs": {
        "name": "my-typexs-module"
    }
}
```

A modul containing this declaration and whose location is under
```
./node_modules
# or
./packages
# or
./src/packages
```

will be automatically integrated on startup of the framework.

In the "typexs" section of the package.json can also be added
additional declartions for modul specific autoload paths, which are
processed by the module to look up for addons or extensions.
For example if the module implements an api which can be
dynamically used or extended. Other modules extensions can be
automatically integrated by placing their extensions under
the specific path and when the handling module
loads it can load all the other extensions.

```js
{
    // ...
    "typexs": {
        "name": "my-typexs-module",
        "declareLibs": [
            {
                "topic": "my_great_extension",
                "refs": [
                    // using glob pattern from modul
                    // root path (where package.json is placed)
                    "GreatExtension",
                    // using src prefix for local development lookups
                    "src/GreatExtension",
                    // using directories
                    "src/great_extensions/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    // ...
}
```

Modules extending "my-typexs-module" can put their code under the declared
ref paths and they will be handled be "my-typexs-module".

To get programmatically all declared classes for a topic can be
done through the RuntimeLoader class object like this:
```typescript
import {RuntimeLoader, IActivator} from '@typexs/base';

export class Activator implements IActivator {

    @Inject(RuntimeLoader.NAME)
    loader: RuntimeLoader;

    startup(){
        // getting all implemented classes declared by this modul
        const classes = this.loader.getClasses('my_great_extension');
        // doing something ...
    }
}
```


During the booting of typexs all declared modules are looked up and
their settings are analysed to get all the declared paths and dependencies
between them. Additionally declaring topic paths can be overridden by the
configuration.

Through the analysis of the dependencies the correct modul load order is
determined and during the bootstrap considered.

The bootstrap of modules happens in three stages. At first we start with

* the activation stage followed by
* the startup stage and ending with
* the ready stage.

The activations stage is for handling initial modul specific configurations
or declaring classes or instance for dependency injection, which can or must
be present for the second stage the startup. To hook in the activation stage
the module must have a Activator.(t|j)s (or src/Activator.(t|j)s) file
with a class implementing the IActivator interface from @typexs/base.
Some objects are at this point ready for injection, if they are needed:

* Storage +
+
--
```typescript
@Inject(Storage.NAME)
storage: Storage;
```
--
* StorageRef's
+
--
```typescript
// C_DEFAULT_STORAGE = 'storage.default'
@Inject(C_DEFAULT_STORAGE)
storageRef: StorageRef;
```
--
* RuntimeLoader
+
--
```typescript
@Inject(RuntimeLoader.NAME)
loader: RuntimeLoader;
```
--

Here an example:
```typescript
// ./Activator.ts

import {IActivator, Injector} from '@typexs/base';

export class Activator implements IActivator {

    startup(){
        // modul specific stuff
        const config = Config.get('my_stuff')
        const handler = new MyHandler(config);
        Injector.set(MyHandler, handler);
    }
}
```


In the second stage of bootstrap all activation over all modules are done
and ready for usage. In this stage you can do initial
loading, registering or processing and stuff that is necessary to make the
modul work properly.  To hook in this stage
the module must have a Startup.(t|j)s (or src/Startup.(t|j)s) file
with a class implementing the IBootstrap (for shutdown operation the IShutdown
interface) interface from @typexs/base.
```typescript
// ./Startup.ts

import {IBootstrap, Inject} from '@typexs/base';

export class Startup implements IBootstrap {

    @Inject(MyHandler)
    greatHandler: MyHandler;


    bootstrap(){
        this.greatHandler.letsRock();
    }
}
```

The last stage is executed after the startup stage. In this stage all modules
went through activation and startup so the system is fully ready for further
processing. This stage can be used if the module depends on fully loaded system.
To hook in this stage is to use the interface IStartup and implement the
method ready().
```typescript
// ./Startup.ts

import {IBootstrap, Inject} from '@typexs/base';

export class Startup implements IBootstrap {

    @Inject(MyHandler)
    greatHandler: MyHandler;

    ready(){
        this.greatHandler.fireMessageSystemIsReady();
    }
}
```


The hooking in the stages is optional and depends only on developer archtecture
or integration level decision. So a typexs module could also implement only
some extensions without interact with the bootstrap.


### Enabling/disabling modules

```yml

modules:
    included:
        'module1':
            enabled: false | true

```


```yml

modules:
    match:
    - name: 'module*'
      enabled: false

```
