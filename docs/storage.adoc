## Storage

At least one storage location must be declared and present when you
running typexs. By default the predefined storage with the name 'default'
is given and awaits a sqlite inmemory database. The default configuration
if none other is given is (in yaml notation):

```yml
storage:
  default:
    # typeorm is currently the default framework
    framework: typeorm
    type: sqlite
    database: :memory:
    synchronize: true,
    connectOnStartup: false
```

This will be overwritten by a declared configuration.



### Storage-Options

### Declaring a new storage

To declare a new storage location you must
Declare location of entities for declaring storage.

```
storage:
  default:


    # extends by an existing storage schema
    extends: string | string[]
```



entity.libs



### Configuration

```
storage:
  default:


    # extends by an existing storage schema
    extends: string | string[]
```

### Quering

M(a|o)ngo Expressions are used to query or run aggregation on the underlying datasource.
The quering syntax orientates mostly on mongo query languange.
But will also be converted for SQL backends.

The conversion to sql for typeorm datasources is processed by ``TypeOrmSqlConditionBuilder``.

#### Matching operations

*$eq* - Equal

```
{field: 'value'}

# or

{field: {$eq: 'value'}}
```
