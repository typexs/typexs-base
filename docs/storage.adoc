*STILL WIP*

## Storage

* Declaring a storage

### Configuration

```
storage:
  default:


    # extends by an existing storage schema
    extends: string | string[]
```

### Quering

M(a|o)ngo Expressions are used to query or run aggregation on the underlying datasource.
The quering syntax orientates mostly on mongo query languange.
But will also be converted for SQL backends.

The conversion to sql for typeorm datasources is processed by ``TypeOrmSqlConditionBuilder``.

#### Matching operations

*$eq* - Equal

```
{field: 'value'}

# or

{field: {$eq: 'value'}}
```
