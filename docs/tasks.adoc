## Tasks

Process units with input and output + return parameter
which can spawn subprocess

### Configuration

Allowing or denying registration of tasks.

```
# deny all tasks but not the tasks which name starts with 'mytasks_'
tasks:
  access:
  - task: *
    access: deny
  - task: mytasks_*
    access: allow
```


### API


#### Task implementation

in directory tasks or src/tasks can be also in subdirectories implements ITask

#### Execution

Programmatically

```typescript
const executor = Injector.create(TaskExecutor)
executor.create(
    taskSpec as TASK_RUNNER_SPEC[],
    parameters as any,
    execOptions as ITaskExectorOptions
)
await executor.run()
```


* describe options

#### Execution


#### TaskRuntimeContainer

Inject the task runtime container to pass progress information, status updates or
log entries to the runtime enviroment. Use TaskRuntime annotation to inject the container
object. The interface ITaskRuntimeContainer definies the providen methods.

```js
export class SomeTask {

  @TaskRuntime()
  runtime: ITaskRuntimeContainer;

  ...
}
```

##### Task logging

Example:

```js
  ...

  async exec(){
    const logger = this.runtime.logger();
    logger.info('everything is fine');
  }

  ...
```

The logger passes the log information to the runtime enviroment, which defines based on
the configuration which logging mechanism is used. If none is configured then the default
runtime node mechanism is used.


*Configuration*
```


tasks
  logger:
  - task: *
    use: deny

  - task: mytasks_*
    access: allow
```


### Integration / implementation

* as Function
* as Class
* as Instance

How to query over multiple nodes ???

Local node task execution logging

* TaskStorageExtension


Distributed query by different backends and nodes

1. nodes have different backends?
2. nodes have same backend? => create system entry

On startup the system creates or updates the system node entry in the underlaying backend.
So if a distributed query is executed, we know which nodes using an other backend and
where an additional query must be executed and the results collected back.

Distributed query:

1. fire query request to known nodes
2. wait for all responses
3. sort correctly
