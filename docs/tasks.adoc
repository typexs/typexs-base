## Tasks


### Configuration

Allowing or denying registration of tasks.

```
# deny all tasks but not the tasks which name starts with 'mytasks_'
tasks:
  access:
  - task: *
    access: deny
  - task: mytasks_*
    access: allow
```


### API


#### TaskRuntimeContainer

Inject the task runtime container to pass progress information, status updates or
log entries to the runtime enviroment. Use TaskRuntime annotation to inject the container
object. The interface ITaskRuntimeContainer definies the providen methods.

```js
export class SomeTask {

  @TaskRuntime()
  runtime: ITaskRuntimeContainer;

  ...
}
```

##### Task logging

Example:

```js
  ...

  async exec(){
    const logger = this.runtime.logger();
    logger.info('everything is fine');
  }

  ...
```

The logger passes the log information to the runtime enviroment, which defines based on
the configuration which logging mechanism is used. If none is configured then the default
runtime node mechanism is used.
