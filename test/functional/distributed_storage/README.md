## Distributed storage testing


For each operation there must be done system tests when supported:

* mongo
* sql


Tests must be for node combinations:

* running on single localy used node
* running on multiple nodes
* running on single remote node in multinode network


Test the different result output options:

*   mode?: 'map' | 'only_value' | 'embed_nodeId' | 'raw';
